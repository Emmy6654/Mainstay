# Mainstay — Proof of Maintenance for Industrial Assets

A decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) built on Stellar Soroban smart contracts, creating verifiable maintenance audit trails for heavy industrial machinery.

Mainstay solves the **Information Asymmetry** problem in asset financing — lenders don't know the true physical condition of a machine. By anchoring every maintenance event on-chain, Mainstay creates an immutable, verifiable lifecycle record that transforms industrial assets into credible DeFi collateral.

## 🎯 What is Mainstay?

Mainstay is a "digital twin" registry for heavy machinery (generators, turbines, vehicles, and other industrial assets). Each asset gets an on-chain identity whose state is updated exclusively by certified engineers — verified through a Federated Engineering credential system.

Every maintenance task is:

- **Signed** by a certified engineer with a verified on-chain credential
- **Recorded** as an immutable event on the Stellar blockchain
- **Aggregated** into a Soroban-based Life-Cycle Contract that reflects the asset's true condition

This makes Mainstay:

✅ **Trustless** (no central maintenance authority needed)  
✅ **Tamper-proof** (maintenance history cannot be altered or backdated)  
✅ **Credentialed** (only verified engineers can sign maintenance events)  
✅ **Collateral-ready** (assets with verified records qualify for DeFi lending)

## 🚀 Features

- **Asset Registry**: Register industrial assets with unique on-chain identities
- **Engineer Verification**: Federated credentialing system for certified maintenance engineers
- **Maintenance Signing**: Engineers cryptographically sign and submit maintenance records
- **Life-Cycle Contracts**: Soroban contracts that track full asset maintenance history
- **Collateral Scoring**: On-chain health score derived from verified maintenance completeness
- **DeFi Integration**: Assets with verified records usable as collateral for Stellar-based lending protocols

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (1.70+)
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar CLI

### Build

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Test

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

### Setup Environment

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
# Network configuration
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org

# Contract addresses (after deployment)
CONTRACT_ASSET_REGISTRY=<your-contract-id>
CONTRACT_ENGINEER_REGISTRY=<your-contract-id>
CONTRACT_LIFECYCLE=<your-contract-id>

# Frontend configuration
VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
```

Network configurations are defined in `environments.toml`:

- `testnet` — Stellar testnet
- `mainnet` — Stellar mainnet
- `futurenet` — Stellar futurenet
- `standalone` — Local development

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Configure your testnet identity first
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh
```

## 🎓 Smart Contract API

### Asset Registry

```rust
register_asset(asset_id, asset_type, metadata) -> u64
get_asset(asset_id) -> Asset
get_lifecycle_score(asset_id) -> u32
```

### Engineer Registry

```rust
register_engineer(engineer_address, credential_hash, issuer)
verify_engineer(engineer_address) -> bool
revoke_credential(engineer_address)
```

### Maintenance Records

```rust
submit_maintenance(asset_id, task_type, notes, engineer_signature)
get_maintenance_history(asset_id) -> Vec<MaintenanceRecord>
get_last_service(asset_id) -> MaintenanceRecord
```

### Collateral

```rust
get_collateral_score(asset_id) -> u32
is_collateral_eligible(asset_id) -> bool
```

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:

✅ Asset registration and metadata  
✅ Engineer credential issuance and verification  
✅ Maintenance record submission and signing  
✅ Life-cycle contract state transitions  
✅ Collateral score calculation  
✅ Error handling and edge cases  

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 🌍 Why This Matters

**The Problem — Information Asymmetry in Asset Financing:**

Industrial assets like generators, turbines, and heavy vehicles represent trillions of dollars in potential collateral globally. Yet lenders routinely reject or under-value these assets because there is no reliable way to verify their physical condition. Maintenance records are paper-based, easily falsified, and siloed.

**The Blockchain Solution:**

- No need for a trusted third-party inspector
- Transparent, append-only maintenance history
- Cryptographic proof that a certified engineer performed each task
- Accessible to any DeFi lender with a Stellar wallet

**Target Users:**

- Industrial asset owners seeking financing
- DeFi lenders needing verifiable collateral
- Certified maintenance engineers building on-chain reputation
- Equipment leasing and fleet management companies

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **v1.0 (Current)**: Asset registry, engineer credentialing, basic maintenance records
- **v1.1**: Collateral scoring engine, DeFi lender API
- **v2.0**: IoT sensor integration (automated maintenance triggers)
- **v3.0**: Frontend dashboard with wallet integration
- **v4.0**: Mobile app for field engineers, multi-asset portfolio view
